                    <p>There are two players: A (1st row) and B (2nd row).</p>
                    <p>Each player gets a row of <i>n</i> squares with <i>n</i> pebbles in each. </p>
                    <p>A move by a player involves picking up all pebbles in one of his squares and distributing 
                    them clockwise by dropping one pebble into each square starting with the next square in the 
                    clockwise direction (pebbles are dropped into his and opponent's squares) until all pebbles 
                    have been dropped. </p>
                    <p>A player has to make a move if he has at least one non-empty square. If all his squares are 
                    empty, he loses and the other player wins. </p>
                    <p>There is no draw. Player A gets the top row and B gets the bottom row. A moves first, B next 
                    and so on. </p>
